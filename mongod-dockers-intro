hi
Mongodb advantages ->
1. we can store data in multiple formats , list dictionaries, arrays etc..
(all these are stored in 'bson' format : bitwise json format)

ability to scale horizontally : we can dsitribute data across mutiple servers
(large datasets and high availability)

also support - rich queries, indexing and aggregation

Dockers and containization -> has ability to store everything my application needs
1. runs the application in all servers and systems the same way
2. can run multiple applications on the same server without them interfering with each other
3. efficiency, light weight , and same server as the host operating server
4. scalability - can handle multiple users

Docker composed -> tool to run multiple docker application
elements of docker composed ->
YAMl file -> to configure application services
single command -> allows starting all services with a single command
environment managment -> can manage multiple environments)vm) for my application
network creation -> automatically creates network for my applications containers

we will use a docker file to define the environment for fastapi backend,
docker composed for move orchestrate through for react front end and mongodb database
